===START EXERCISES=== SEED: Structured Bash environment resolution
Analyze the system and apply precise actions:
    1. Identify active Bash processes:
→ ps aux | grep '[.]sh'
→ Extract name and PID.
    2. Detect processes with CPU usage > 30%:
→ ps aux --sort=-%cpu | awk '$3>30 {print $11, $2, $3}'
    3. Delete old logs in /tmp/logs:
→ find /tmp/logs -name '*.log' -mtime +7 -print
→ Confirm before executing rm.
    4. Detect scripts without execution permission in ~/scripts:
→ find ~/scripts -name '*.sh' ! -executable
    5. Check duplicates in errores.txt:
→ sort errores.txt | uniq -d
    6. Create summary in ~/salida.txt:
→ Include number of processes, deleted files, corrected permissions.

Every instruction requires prior validation. Priority: preserve structure, avoid redundancy, apply logic.
